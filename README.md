# Next.js Project

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework, and was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. **Install Dependencies**

    Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2. **Start the Development Server**

    Use the following command to start the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The server runs on port 3000. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

3. **Build and Run the Production Server**

    To create a production build of the application, run:

    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```

    After the build is complete, start the production server with:

    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

    The production server also runs on port 3000.
